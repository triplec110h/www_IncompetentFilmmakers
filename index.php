	Formerly Phatcyd Films, but we assure you this is more than a name change. Our goal is to produce quality films that you, the audience, can connect with or be repulsed by. We're not interested in where on the emotional spectrum that our stories hit you, as long as the aforementioned hit is hard and violent.
	</p>

	<p>
	Don't worry, if we were going to keep making the same sub-par films, we would have kept doing so under Phatcyd.
